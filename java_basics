Binary Number Representation
  Java uses two's complement to represent integer
  to change the sign of integer flip all bits and add 1 which is 2 complemnt basically
  b = ~a --> bitwise complement 
  a&b
  a|b
  a^b
  a<<x  x--> how many you want yo shift and new ppositions will be filled with 0
  a>>x signed right shift, new positions fills with either 1 or 0 based on the sign 
  a>>>x unsigned right shift, fills with 0 only



Operators
  = to assign
  == 
  !=
  >,<,<=,>=
  !
  &&
  ||
  ^
  (| or ||)  If we are able to determine the over all result based on the fisrt condition then no need to check the second comdition 
  In this case we need to use ||   Example (1>0 || 5>0)  if we use just | both have to be evaluated ---> just for performance
  But it makes difference if arthematic operations comes into picture in conditions
  

if/else/else if (condition) { }
int c = (1>0) ? 2 : (5<2) ? 3 : 0;

switch (status) {
  case "S" :
    do someting
  case "D" :
    do someting
    break
  default :
    do someting
}     
It will continue from the the case match until break happpens


double price = switch (status) {
  case "S", "N" -> cost += 1;      --> result is assigned to price
    case "C"  -> 0;                --> o is assigned to price
    case "D" -> {do semthing ..    --> yeild keyword must be used in case of block and discount is assigned to price
      yeild discount;
    }
    default -> 3;                  --> defautt must be there in case of assignment
};


: --> old syntax
-> --> new syntax 

In case of using switch as flow
  :  --> need to have break or else if will fall to next case
  ->  --> it wont fall into nect case

In case of using switch as assignment
  :  --> yeild is must to assign or else jumps to next case  like switch flow, if no yeilds are there then it will throw exception
  as there was no assignment made. Must not use break beacuse yeild will work like break after assignment wont jump to next case and also if
  we use break no assignment would happen which is wrong. 
  ->  --> assignemnt can be done through simple expression and no fallign to next case. Yeild is must in case of block statements. Must not use break
